### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an **excited** teen learning code, and hoping to make big proyects to help people
I'm currently studying physics at _Universidad de Antioquia_, where I've learned how to code in Python, standing out between my classmates

I've code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Python and Java, **and I'm learning about them everyday!**
